# fraud_detection_system
A credit card fraud detection system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. This project aims to develop models that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, utilizing techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. By addressing challenges like imbalanced datasets and ensuring high accuracy, the system enhances the security of credit card transactions.

Project Overview

Objective: To create a robust credit card fraud detection system that minimizes false positives while accurately identifying fraudulent transactions.

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders, with a significant class imbalance (only 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent).

Key Features: The dataset includes numerical features derived from PCA transformations, along with 'Time' (elapsed seconds since the first transaction) and 'Amount' (transaction value).

Tech Stack : Python
